Transactions on FragmentManager is divided into 3:
* add
* remove
* replace

To dynamically change fragments, we need a container view to reference and hold each fragment.

Static Fragment does _NOT_ need a container view, such as: a list of images. List won't change during run-time.

# What is GETTER and SETTER methods?
Class is an Object and its properties are private. For ex: human is an object. We can see our friends and colleagues with our eyes. They are visible.
But we can't tell their Home Address, Cell Number, DOB, etc. How to know? We need to communicate with them.
Same thing as this Setter and Getter methods that we use to communicate between classes so we can access their private properties.

Setter is used to SET a private property of a class.
Getter is used to GET a private property of a class by using return.
